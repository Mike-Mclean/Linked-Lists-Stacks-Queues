# Linked List, Stack, and Queue Implementation

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures:

- Singly Linked List
- Stack (using a linked list for storage)
- Queue (using a linked list for storage)

These implementations are designed to demonstrate how these data structures work and for reference for future projects.

## Features of each data structure:
- Linked List: Supports basic operations like insertion, removal, slicing, and list reversal for a linked list with a sentinel at the head.
- Stack: Follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, implemented using a linked list.
- Queue: Follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, also implemented using a linked list.
